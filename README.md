# ⚖️ Court Case Search — Legal Research with CourtListener API ⚖️

A Streamlit-powered application that lets users search U.S. court cases through the CourtListener v4 API, returning case name, court, date, citation, and direct URL

This project demonstrates skills in API integration, data handling, and UI design with python, and reflects my interest in applying technology to improve access to legal information.
